        "\n",
        "*   **Symptom-Disease Data Acquisition:** A simulated dataset named `df_symptom_disease` was successfully created and loaded. It maps symptom combinations to diseases (e.g., \"headache,fever,fatigue\" to \"Common Cold\"). An initial parsing issue with comma-separated symptoms was resolved by quoting the symptom lists in the input string.\n",
        "*   **Data Preprocessing:** A new column, `processed_symptoms`, was added to `df_symptom_disease`. This column contains lists of individual symptoms, extracted, lowercased, and stripped of whitespace (e.g., `['headache', 'fever', 'fatigue']`), preparing the data for machine learning.\n",
        "*   **Basic Diagnostic Model Implementation:** A `LogisticRegression` model was successfully trained using the `processed_symptoms` (transformed into a numerical feature matrix by `MultiLabelBinarizer`, resulting in a matrix of shape `(5, 12)`). This model can predict diseases based on symptom inputs. For example, inputting `['headache', 'fever']` predicted 'Common Cold', and `['nausea', 'headache', 'vomiting']` predicted 'Migraine'.\n",
        "*   **Symptom Extraction Logic:** A robust `extract_symptoms_from_text` function was developed using regular expressions. It accurately identifies known symptoms (from a vocabulary of 12 unique symptoms) within free-text user input, using word boundaries to ensure precise matching and sorting symptoms by length to prioritize longer phrases.\n",
        "*   **Integrated Chatbot Response Mechanism:** A `combined_chatbot_response` function was implemented. This function prioritizes symptom extraction; if symptoms are identified, it uses the diagnostic model and appends a clear medical disclaimer. If no symptoms are found, it falls back to a standard Q&A retrieval system.\n",
        "*   **Diagnostic Model Performance (Test Phase):** When presented with clear symptom queries (e.g., \"I have a headache, fever, and fatigue.\"), the chatbot successfully triggered the diagnostic model, extracted symptoms, provided relevant disease predictions based on the trained model, and consistently included the medical disclaimer.\n",
        "*   **Q&A Fallback Failure for Ambiguous Queries:** A critical issue was identified where, for ambiguous or general health queries (e.g., \"I feel generally unwell.\"), the chatbot correctly identified no known symptoms but **failed to provide a relevant Q&A response**. Instead, it consistently defaulted to an incorrect answer (\"What is diabetes?\"), indicating a flaw in the Q&A retrieval's handling of non-direct matches.\n",
        "*   **Q&A Fallback Success for Direct Queries:** For direct Q&A queries (e.g., \"What is diabetes?\"), the Q&A fallback mechanism worked correctly, providing accurate and relevant answers from the medical Q&A dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Urgent Q&A Fallback Improvement:** The Q&A retrieval system needs significant enhancement to gracefully handle ambiguous or non-matching queries. This could involve implementing a relevance threshold, a \"no relevant information found\" response, or providing more general health information instead of defaulting to an incorrect answer.\n",
        "*   **Expand Knowledge Base:** To improve diagnostic accuracy and coverage, the symptom-disease dataset needs to be expanded substantially. This involves acquiring a much larger, diverse, and real-world dataset to enable the model to cover a wider range of conditions and symptoms.\n"

        "### Diagnosis of Q&A Fallback Threshold\n",
        "\n",
        "**Issue Identified:** The chatbot was returning irrelevant answers when falling back to the Q&A system for certain ambiguous queries (e.g., \"What is the meaning of life?\" returning an answer about diabetes). For these queries, the `similarity_distance` between the user's input and the most similar question in `df_medical_qa` was around `0.49`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Root Cause:** The `relevance_threshold` in the `get_chatbot_response` function is set to `0.6`. Since `similarity_distance` represents `1 - cosine_similarity`, a lower distance indicates higher similarity. The condition `similarity_distance < relevance_threshold` means that any query with a distance less than 0.6 (i.e., a cosine similarity greater than 0.4) is considered 'relevant enough' to trigger a specific answer from the Q&A dataset. In the case of \"What is the meaning of life?\", a distance of `0.49` is less than `0.6`, hence it triggered the closest Q&A entry, which happened to be \"What is diabetes?\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:** The `relevance_threshold` of `0.6` is too permissive for the current TF-IDF + NearestNeighbors setup and the small Q&A dataset. It allows queries that are not truly semantically close to pass as relevant, leading to incorrect responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:** The `relevance_threshold` needs to be significantly lowered (e.g., to `0.3` or `0.2`) to ensure that only very similar questions trigger a Q&A response. This will make the chatbot more discerning and lead to the generic fallback message for truly irrelevant or ambiguous queries, rather than providing an incorrect but highly confident answer."

        "*   After modifying the `get_chatbot_response` function to always print the `similarity_distance` and the most similar question, it was found that for an irrelevant query like \"What is the meaning of life?\", the `similarity_distance` was approximately 0.49, and it incorrectly matched \"What is diabetes?\".\n",
        "*   The `relevance_threshold` was set to 0.6. Since `similarity_distance` represents `1 - cosine_similarity`, a value of 0.49 (meaning cosine similarity of \\~0.51) was considered \"relevant enough\" to trigger a specific Q&A answer, despite the query being semantically irrelevant.\n",
        "*   A `similarity_distance` of 0.0 indicates a perfect match (e.g., for \"What is diabetes?\" matching \"What is diabetes?\"), while a distance of 1.0 indicates no similarity, correctly triggering the generic fallback for truly ambiguous queries.\n",
        "*   The current `relevance_threshold` of 0.6 is too high, allowing queries that are not truly semantically close to be considered relevant, leading to incorrect specific responses rather than the intended generic fallback.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The `relevance_threshold` in the `get_chatbot_response` function should be significantly lowered (e.g., to 0.3 or 0.2) to ensure that only very similar questions trigger a Q&A response, making the system more discerning.\n",

        "*   **`LogisticRegression`:** A classification model trained on the binarized symptom features (`X_symptoms`) and their corresponding diseases (`y_diseases`). It predicts a disease based on a set of input symptoms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Symptom Extraction Logic:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**5. Combined Chatbot Response Logic (`combined_chatbot_response` function):**\n",
        "This central function orchestrates the chatbot's behavior:\n",
        "*   **Symptom Prioritization:** It first attempts to extract symptoms from the user's query.\n",
        "*   **Diagnostic Path:** If symptoms are identified, it triggers the `LogisticRegression` model to predict a disease. The response includes the predicted disease and a mandatory medical disclaimer.\n",
        "*   **Q&A Fallback:** If no symptoms are found, or if a diagnostic Q&A query is made, it falls back to the `TfidfVectorizer` and `NearestNeighbors` models to find the most relevant answer from `df_medical_qa`.\n",
        "*   **Relevance Threshold Adjustment:** A critical improvement involved adjusting the `relevance_threshold` in the Q&A fallback mechanism from `0.6` to `0.2`. This change makes the chatbot more discerning, ensuring that only truly semantically similar questions trigger a specific Q&A response. Irrelevant or ambiguous queries now correctly receive a generic 'no information' message, preventing misleading answers."
